# We try to retarget `Pf` at `Thm2` instead of `Thm1`.

# no node can have multiple `EXPANDS` edges leaving it.
# A subtle point: In order to trigger the exception we want, we
# have to ensure that this proof still contains the ghost node
# `Pf.Thm1.C`. Otherwise the disappearance of that ghost node
# will be caught as an exception (since we didn't mention it in
# our change log), before we can hit the exception we want.
