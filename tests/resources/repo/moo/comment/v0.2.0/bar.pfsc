anno NotesS on Pf.S @@@
These are some notes on node `S` in the proof.

And <goal:w1>[this]{} is a goal widget.

deduc xpan_S of Pf.S {

    asrt A {
        en = "A supporting fact."
    }

    meson = "
    Pf.S by A and Pf.R.
    "
}

anno NotesT on Pf.T @@@
These are some notes on node `T` in the proof.

We now add a fancy new widget that makes these notes better:
<qna:w1>[]{
    question: "What is $-1$ as a complex exponential?",
    answer: "$@rme sup i pie;$"
}

deduc xpan_T of Pf.T {

        en = "An underlying observation."
    }

    meson = "
    Pf.T by B.
    "
