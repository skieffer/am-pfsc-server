Some enlightening notes...
with a <chart:w10>[chart widget with *cool equation* $@e sup i pie; + 1 = 0$ in the label]{
    "view": "Pf"
}
This time we give it its own name, and even put it in a different pane group.
Now let's add checkboxes.
<chart:w20>[]{
    "view": "X",
    "group": 2,
    "checkboxes": {
        "deducs": "Pf"
    }
}
