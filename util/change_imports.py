"""
Utility script for updating all import statements in a Proofscape repo, following
the (hopefully rare) change in the way import statements work in .pfsc modules.

Most recent usaage (17 Jul 2019): We are making it so the first dot in a relative
 import means "this module". Therefore, at this time, all existing relative import
 paths need to be extended by one dot.
