# Contributing

Welcome! We're glad you're interested in contributing to this project.

If you've found a bug, or if you have a great idea for a new feature, please
start by searching open (and even closed) issues, to see if we're onto it
already. If you don't find what you're looking for, please go ahead and open
an issue!

If there's an issue that you want to work on, it's usually best to have some
discussion before you begin coding. This way you can find out if someone is
already working on it, or if ideas about the issue have changed since the last
time the issue was discussed.
