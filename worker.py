"""
We follow the advice given [here](https://python-rq.org/docs/workers/#performance-notes),
and preload libraries in order to improve RQ worker performance.

In tests performed on a 2019 MacBook Pro, in Chrome 86.0.4240.111,
saving a 3866-byte pfsc module took about 1400ms without preloading libraries,
but took only about 350ms with preloading. In terms of user experience, this
is a very perceptible latency difference!
