# Connect handler

# The connect handler is not purely a part of the Window Peers Protocol,
# but we define it here in this module anyway. It _supports_ our implementation
# of the protocol. But it also serves another purpose: generally speaking,
# Handlers that handle long-running tasks may wish to groupcast a socket event
# as notification when the task is completed, and they can send this event to
# the "CSRF Room," which is established by the connect handler.

@socketio.on('connect', namespace=NAMESPACE)
def on_connect():
    """
    We add all of a user's socket connections to a common room. We want this room
    to have a unique, unguessable name, and we want that name to be recorded in
    the user's Flask session. The existing CSRF token in the user's session fits
    the bill perfectly, so we use it as the name of the room.

    This provides a trustworthy way of groupcasting an event to all of a user's
    sockets in response to an HTTPS request, without the user having to nominate
    a recipient socket ID as an arg in that request.

    Note that with Flask-SocketIO, socket handlers always see the Flask session
    as it was at the time the connect event occurred, which is why it is possible
    for us to read the existing CSRF token here in this handler.

    See <https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementation_notes.html#access-to-flask-s-context-globals>
