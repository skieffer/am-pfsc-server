    When the Forest is handling a request to update the state in a chart panel, this handler helps
    it figure out what it needs to do, and supplies all the data necessary to do it, in convenient format.

    NOTE: All the input for this handler is expected to come under a single JSON serialized object.
    Accordingly, in our `check_input` method we use `self.check_jsa`.

    INPUT:

        current_forest: dict representing the entire forest of deducs currently on board, including the libpath and
          version of each, and showing the expansion structure. It looks sth like this:

            {
                libpath.of.a.Thm@vers: {
                    libpath.of.Pf.of.Thm@vers: {
                        libpath.of.an.expansion.on.Pf@vers: {},
                        libpath.of.another.expansion.on.Pf@vers: {}
                    }
                },
                libpath.of.another.Thm@vers: {}
            }

          and it can be obtained as the return value of `Floor.writeVersionedForestRepn()` in Moose.

        on_board: boxlisting indicating any elements (nodes and/or deducs), all of which you want to be on the
          board (and some of which may already be there).

        reload: boxlisting indicating elements -- presumably already on the board -- which you want reloaded/refreshed;
          if an element is in fact absent, it is no error, it just means the same thing as `on_board`;
          keyword 'all' is permitted, meaning everything on board is to be reloaded.

        to_view: boxlisting indicating elements that are to be viewed; keyword 'all' is permitted, meaning you
          want an overview of all elements.

        desired_versions: dict, mapping libpaths to full version strings, indicating the versions at which
          you want deducs to be loaded.

          For every libpath listed in any of the three above arguments (`on_board`, `reload`, and `to_view`) either this
          dict, or the `current_forest` dict, must supply a version number. We check `desired_versions` first, and go to
          `current_forest` only if necessary.

          Note that both lookups will be interpreted as "reversible prefix mappings."
          This means that not every libpath needing a version has to be a key, but if not then either some proper
          segmentwise prefix or extension of it must be, in order to find a match. Prefixes are allowed because these
          are, by definition, prefix mappings. Extensions are allowed (and this is what makes them "reversible") because
          it makes sense: if a node is desired at a certain version, that implies that so is its deduc.

        off_board: boxlisting indicating any elements you do _not_ want on the board (and may not be there already);
          keyword 'all' is permitted, meaning the board should be cleared of existing deducs. Here the version numbers
          are those implied by `current_forest`.

        incl_nbhd_in_view: boolean; if true, (and if to_view is not 'all') it means that you want to augment `to_view`
          by including the deductive neighborhood of each object in that list -- i.e. all nodes one deduction arc away.

        known_dashgraphs: dict, in which the keys are the libpaths of deductions whose dashgraphs need not be
          loaded from disk, since for whatever reason the ISE already has them, or does not need them. For each
          key `k` in this dict, let `D` be the deduction of which `k` is the libpath. If `D` is a top-level deduction
          (i.e. has no parent, or expands on nothing), then `k` must point to `null`. Otherwise, suppose
          `D` expands on deduc `C` at version `V`. Then `k` must point to the string `C@V`.

        NOTE: It can be tricky to understand what `reload` means w.r.t. versions. The rule is: these are libpaths
        which will be closed if present -- at whatever version they are present -- and will be opened at the version
        indicated in `desired_versions`, again, _regardless of the version that is currently present_. So, reloading
        can be a way to change the version of a deduc on board.

    OUTPUT:

        to_close: list of libpaths of deductions presently on the board, that should be closed.

                 You might think this list should be in reverse-topological order, but instead this list will
                 have the property that if it contains deductions C and D, then neither C nor D is ancestor of
                 the other.

                 A list with this property can do the job because whenever the ISE removes a deduction
                 from the board, it also removes any and all descendants along with it.

        to_open: list of libpaths of deductions that should be opened. If a deduction D appears in this list,
                then either it is not presently on the board, or it is but the user has requested it be reloaded
                (or has requested it at a different version than currently present).

                This list of libpaths is guaranteed to have two properties: (1) it is sorted in _topological
                order_. (2) If united with the set of deducs that will remain on board after the close operation
                indicated by the `to_close` list, you get an ancestrally closed set.

                This means that after performing the close operation, you can open these deducs in the order
                given, and each deduc's ancestors will already be present at the time that it is opened.

        dashgraphs: a lookup, in which the libpaths in the `to_open` list point to the dashgraphs for
                    these deducs, loaded freshly from disk, except that any libpaths that were named in the
                    `known_dashgraphs` input field will not have an entry here.

        view_closure: equal to `to_view` if `incl_nbhd_in_view` was `False` or if `to_view` was `'all'`; otherwise
            equal to the neighborhood-closure of `to_view`, i.e. `to_view` plus all nodes one arc away from nodes therein.

        NOTE: We need not return version numbers for the libpaths in `to_open`, because that information is available
        in the returned `dashgraphs` lookup (or in any known dashgraphs you already had on the client side).

    NOTE: If an impossible state is requested, behavior is undefined. (It is deterministic, but we make no claim
    about what it will be.) For example, if D <-- E and you ask that E be on board but D be off board, you are
    requesting an impossible state. We will return something, but of course it will not achieve what you asked for.

        FIXME
        This is a tricky one. To really do it right, we probably can't do a preliminary
        check here at all; we probably have to just `pass` here, and perform checks at
        several different places in the methods that follow.

        If we didn't care about "libpath espionage" (i.e. learning things about the
        set of libpaths present in a repo you do not own), then this would be very easy.
        We wouldn't need to do any check at all. Where we load dashgraphs in our
        `step_040_ancestors` method, we rely on a DashgraphLoader, and the latter would do
        all the necessary permission checking for us.

        But since we do care about libpath espionage, we have to be careful about what
        we return in `to_open` and `view_closure` too. For example, Let R be a repo you
        do not own. If in `to_view` you named a node v belonging to R, and in `desired_versions`
        you said you wanted repo R at WIP, then in the `view_closure` part of the response
        you could learn:

            * that libpath(v) is indeed present in R@WIP
            * the libpaths of all nodes one deduction arc away from v in R@WIP

        Or again, suppose in `on_board` you named a deduc d belonging to R. Then from `to_open`
        you could learn:

            * that libpath(d) is indeed present in R@WIP
            * the libpaths of all ancestors of d in R@WIP

        To prevent this, it would again be easy if only `desired_versions` could come to bear.
        But in fact `current_forest` has to be checked too, since we have the mechanism where we
        fall back on `current_forest` when `desired_versions` is silent.

        This means if we want to do a _preliminary_ check, i.e. one happening right here,
        before we get into the thick of computing various sets in the methods below, we have
        to check permissions on _all_ repos named at WIP in `current_forest`.

        But this has the unintended consequence that we might refuse to help
        a user update the state in a chart in which a deduc is _already open_ at WIP from a repo
        they don't own, even if their request does not involve learning anything new about that
        repo. That is odd behavior.

        Admittedly, this should be an edge case in practice. It could arise if you were logged
        in, opened a deduc from a repo you own at WIP, then logged out while that chart was still
        open, then attempted to open something else in that chart.

        Arguably, having WIP that you don't own open in a chart in your app is a weird state
        that we don't really need to support smoothly, at least in beta. So for now I'm going
        to err on the safe side and just do a preliminary check on all repos named in both
        `current_forest` and in `desired_versions`. Later, we may wish to refine this a bit.
