    This is our internal representation for a comparison recorded in a node's
    `cf` field.

    For now, we are only accepting very simple raw values: they must be a
    libpath, which resolves to some object that is available in the module,
    i.e. that was imported or defined there.

    In the future, we may consider broadening the set of accepted values:
    * We could accept string libpaths, which needn't resolve. This could
      help with cyclic import issues.
    * We could accept dictionaries, so that besides just a libpath, other info
      could also be supplied, such as a comment, or some categorization tags.
