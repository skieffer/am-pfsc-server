        In our GDB, only those MOVE relations are formed that correspond to
        mappings explicitly noted in a change log. Therefore most movements
        are implicit, and must be computed, essentially as an algebraic
        conjugate, of one of the explicit MOVE relations.

                (s) --[:MOVE]--> (s')

        In the diagram above, (s) is a node that received an explicit MOVE
        relation, carrying it to a node (s'). A node (t) under (s) did not,
        since it was intended to undergo the corresponding move. To be precise,
        if libpath(s) = a, then, since t is under s, we should have libpath(t) = a.b
        for some b. If libpath(s') = a', then the implication is that t moved
        to a node t' with libpath(t') = a'.b.

        In this situation, we say that t' is the "move-conjugate" of t.
        This is because t' is obtained from t by conjugating the nearest MOVE
        relation by the chain of UNDER relations that separates it from t.

        Meanwhile there are always two other possibilities. One is that t did
        not move but "died". This is the case when the nearest MOVE relation
        to t points to the (:Void) node:

                (s) --[:MOVE]--> (:Void)

                (t)

        case when there is no MOVE relation leaving t or any of t's ancestors.

          be computed (t in the discussion above).
