    In order to allow the same code to work both with Neo4j and
    with RedisGraph, this class acts as an adapter, wrapping a RedisGraph
    `Graph` instance, and serving to stand in where any of a Neo4j database,
    session, or transaction would have been used.

    It also ensures that after a transaction is committed, we initiate a
    background save to write dump.rdb to disk.

    Note: An attempt was made to achieve an actual notion of transaction, using
    Redis's MULTI/EXEC/DISCARD commands, and at this time the remnants of that
    code are left commented out below.

    It doesn't work for us because our code (originally written
    to work with Neo4j transactions) expects the sophisticated behavior wherein
    a read following a write shows the results of the write, even before the
    transaction has been committed. Redis doesn't provide that, so our code
    fails. We try to build up all our writes in a single MULTI before finally
    hitting EXEC to run them all, and meanwhile our reads see the wrong things.
