# Theory of reversible prefix matching

We establish in Theorem 4 that, in a sorted list of SortableLibpaths, if p is any subject
in that list, then we have a heading that is a segmentwise extension of p iff the _first_ heading
coming after p is such a one.

**Defn:** Let p and q be libpaths. We say q is an _extension_ of p if len(q) >= len(p) and q[:len(p)] == p.
The extension is said to be _proper_ if len(q) > len(p).

**Defn:** If q is a proper extension of p, then q is said to be a _segmentwise_ or _true_ extension of
p if q[len(p)] == '.'. Otherwise it is called a _false_ extension of p.


**Lemma 1:** Let p, q, r be libpaths with q an extension of p and r not an extension of p.
If p < r, then q < r.

**Proof:** Let n = len(p). Since r > p but r is not an extension of p, there must be some 0 <= k < n such
that r[k] > p[k]. Let k0 be the least such k. So we have

    r[i] == p[i] for 0 <= i < k0

    r[k0] > p[k0].

Since q is an extension of p, we have q[:n] == p. In particular, k0 < n implies

    r[i] == q[i] for 0 <= i < k0

    r[k0] > q[k0],

which means r > q. [ ]


**Lemma 2:** Let p be a libpath, q a true extension of p, and q' a false extension of p. Then q < q'.

**Proof:** Let n = len(p). Since q and q' are both extensions of p, we have q[:n] == q'[:n].
Since they are both _proper_ extensions of p, both q[n] and q'[n] are defined.
Furthermore, since q' is a false extension, we have q'[n] = c for some letter c.
Finally, since q is segmentwise, we have q[n] == '.' < c == q'[n].
It follows that q < q'. [ ]


**Corollary 3:** Let L be any nonempty, sorted list of libpaths, with p = L[0].
Partition the remainder R = L[1:] into three disjoint sets:
    S = the segmentwise extensions of p among R
    F = the false extensions of p among R
    N = the non-extensions of p among R
Then S < F < N, elementwise.

**Proof:** Follows from Lemmas 1 and 2. [ ]

Let's clarify this a bit. Fixing any libpath p, consider any other libpath q != p whatsoever.
Either q is an extension of p, or it is not. If it is, then (being different from p and hence proper)
it is either segmentwise or false.
What Cor 3 is saying is simply that, among q > p, these three types are not mixed up, but neatly
stratified: the segmentwise extensions come first, then the false extensions, and finally the
non-extensions. (Meanwhile on the other side, where q < p, the story is even simpler: all such
q are non-extensions of p.)


**Theorem 4:** Let L be a set of SortableLibpaths. Let p be a subject in L. Let S be
the set of headings in L that are segmentwise extensions of p. Let A be the set of headings
in L that come after p. If S is nonempty, then A is nonempty, and the _first_ element of A
is in S.

**Proof:** S is a subset of A, because all extensions of p come after p. So if S is nonempty,
so is A. So A has a first element a0. According to Cor 3, stratify A into A_S < A_F < A_N.
We have A_S = A ^ S by definition. But S \subseteq A, so A ^ S = S. Then S nonempty says A_S
is nonempty. Then we must have a0 \in A_S. But then a0 \in S. [ ]
