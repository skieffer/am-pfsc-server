    a positive error level, then we serve a standard "download error" page as
    HTML, reporting the error to the user.

    should be a bytes object, and this is what will be downloaded as a file.

    an HTML string, which we serve as HTML.

    Else we again serve the "download error" page, this time constructing a
    canned error message.

    The client should call endpoints that use this handling method by opening
    a small popup window. In cases of success, the file will download, and the
    user can close the popup. In cases of error, the error HTML will be displayed
    in the popup, which again the user can close. Either way, you avoid
    disrupting or navigating away from the page you were on when you requested
    the download.
